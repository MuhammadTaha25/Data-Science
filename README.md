🚀 How to Run

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/cancer-severity-regression.git
cd cancer-severity-regression


Install required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Open the notebook:

jupyter notebook "Cancer Severity (Regression Model).ipynb"

📊 Results

The regression model successfully predicts cancer severity with good accuracy.

Outliers were identified and managed to improve model performance.

Visualizations provide insights into data distribution and relationships.

🔮 Future Improvements

Try advanced regression models (Ridge, Lasso, XGBoost, etc.)

Apply feature engineering to improve predictions

Deploy as a web app (using Streamlit/Flask)
