# Cancer Severity Prediction (Regression Model)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting **cancer severity** using a regression-based machine learning model.  
It processes patient data, analyzes important features, handles outliers, and applies regression techniques to estimate the severity level of cancer.

## ⚙️ Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Outlier detection and handling  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
- Regression model implementation (Linear/Multiple Regression, etc.)  
- Model evaluation using performance metrics  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **NumPy, Pandas** → Data processing  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** → Visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** → Machine learning models & evaluation

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cancer-severity-regression.git
   cd cancer-severity-regressio

📊 Results

The regression model successfully predicts cancer severity with good accuracy.

Outliers were identified and managed to improve model performance.

Visualizations provide insights into data distribution and relationships.

🔮 Future Improvements

Try advanced regression models (Ridge, Lasso, XGBoost, etc.)

Apply feature engineering to improve predictions

Deploy as a web app (using Streamlit/Flask)
